The `<platinum-https-redirect>` element redirects the current page to HTTPS, unless the page is
loaded from a web server running on `localhost`.

Using [HTTP Strict Transport Security](http://www.chromium.org/hsts) (HSTS) provides a more robust
way of enforcing HTTPS, but it requires access to the underlying web server in order to set
appropriate response headers. This element provides a client-side alternative when HSTS isn't
possible.

It comes in handy when used with with other `<platinum-*>` elements, since those elements use
[features which are restricted to HTTPS](http://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secure-origins-for-powerful-new-features),
with an exception to support local web servers.

It can be used by just adding it to any page, e.g.

    <platinum-https-redirect></platinum-https-redirect>
